With all that explained, please select the available stage to start destroying meteors!",

The meteor closest to the Earth's surface is automatically targeted, so all you must do is solve the conversions presented to you.

They will come back a few seconds after a conversion question is given, but this will give more time for meteors to reach the Earth's surface. If you get a conversion wrong, the multipliers will start showing up instantly like before, unless you get enough consecutive correct answers again.",
